The landing page have to state that the user needs to add the correct app to their Planday portal and show a brief guide how to do that (basically add app and input the CLIENT ID) after they need to approve that app in Planday.

Then, once they do that they need to copy their unique token from the Planday app inside their portal and input into the webapp we are making - that will "connect them" to the correct Planday Portal.

Once that is done, we want to give the user the option to also DOWNLOAD an excel template based on their portal, so that they can use that one if they want as well.
