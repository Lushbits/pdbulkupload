# Product Requirements Document: Planday Bulk Employee Uploader

## Executive Summary

A web application that allows Planday customers to bulk upload employees from Excel files directly to their Planday portal via a simple, secure interface with intelligent column mapping, comprehensive validation, and all-or-nothing upload guarantee.

## Problem Statement

Planday customers frequently need to onboard multiple employees simultaneously, but currently must:
- Manually enter each employee one-by-one through the Planday interface
- Use complex API integrations requiring technical expertise
- Struggle with data format requirements and validation errors
- Deal with partial upload failures that create inconsistent data states

## Solution Overview

A client-side web application that:
- Processes Excel files directly in the browser (no server storage)
- Intelligently maps Excel columns to Planday employee fields
- Provides comprehensive pre-validation with editable data correction
- Ensures 100% data validity before any upload attempts
- Performs atomic uploads (all employees succeed or none are created)
- Handles all validation client-side with zero data storage

## Core Features

### 1. Authentication
- Simple refresh token input (no complex OAuth flow)
- Single hardcoded client ID works across all Planday portals
- Clear instructions for obtaining tokens from Planday Settings â†’ API Access
- Secure token handling with browser memory storage only

### 2. Excel File Processing
- Support for .xlsx and .xls formats with comprehensive error handling
- Drag & drop interface with visual feedback and file validation
- Client-side parsing using SheetJS (no data leaves the browser)
- Automatic detection of headers and data rows with smart parsing
- Support for various Excel formatting and data types

### 3. Intelligent Column Mapping
- Auto-detection of common field mappings (firstName, lastName, email, phone)
- Visual interface showing Excel headers vs Planday employee fields
- Department selection with live data from customer's Planday portal
- Required field validation with clear visual indicators
- Support for unmapped columns (ignored during upload)

### 4. Comprehensive Pre-Validation System
- **Complete validation before any API calls**: Zero employees touched until 100% valid

- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive, maintainable design
- **File Processing**: SheetJS (xlsx library) for Excel parsing
- **State Management**: React hooks for component state
- **Deployment**: Vercel static hosting with automatic HTTPS

### Privacy & Security Architecture
- **Zero data storage**: All processing happens in browser memory only
- **Direct API integration**: Browser communicates directly with Planday API
- **No backend services**: Pure client-side application with no server
- **Token security**: Refresh tokens stored in memory, cleared on page refresh
- **HTTPS enforced**: All communications encrypted via Vercel's SSL

### API Integration Strategy
- **Planday HR API**: Employee creation, department lookup, field definitions
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 refresh token to access token exchange
- **Rate limiting compliance**: Batch processing with appropriate delays
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive API error capture and user-friendly messaging
- **Validation endpoints**: Pre-flight checks for departments and duplicates

## Detailed User Journey

### 1. Authentication Phase
- User navigates to application URL
- Enters Planday refresh token in secure input field
- System validates token by attempting to refresh access token
- Success leads to file upload, failure shows clear error message

### 2. File Upload Phase
- User drags Excel file to drop zone or clicks to browse
- System validates file type (.xlsx/.xls) and provides immediate feedback
- Excel file parsed in browser memory with progress indicator
- Headers and data extracted and displayed for user confirmation

### 3. Column Mapping Phase
- System displays Excel headers alongside Planday employee fields
- Auto-mapping applied for obvious matches (firstName, lastName, email)
- User manually maps remaining columns using dropdown selectors
- Department selection from live Planday data
- Required field validation prevents proceeding without essential mappings

### 4. Data Validation & Correction Phase (New Enhanced Phase)
- **Initial validation**: System validates all mapped data client-side
- **Validation report**: Shows count of valid/invalid employees with details
- **Editable grid interface**: User can click any cell to edit invalid data
- **Real-time feedback**: Validation status updates as user makes corrections
- **Progress tracking**: Visual indicator of validation completion percentage
- **Mandatory 100% validity**: Cannot proceed until all employees pass validation

### 5. Final Preview Phase
- Display of 100% validated employee data
- Sample employee record preview showing exact API payload
- Final confirmation before upload with employee count
- Clear messaging about all-or-nothing upload approach

### 6. Atomic Upload Phase
- Pre-flight API checks (department existence, API connectivity)
- Batch upload with progress tracking and current employee status
- All-or-nothing guarantee: complete success or complete rollback
- Real-time progress with success/total counters

### 7. Results Phase
- Success confirmation with total employees created
- Or failure notification with specific error details and retry guidance
- Option to download upload summary report
- Clear path to start new upload or return to mapping

## Validation Rules & Data Quality

### Required Field Validation
- **firstName**: Non-empty string, minimum 1 character
- **lastName**: Non-empty string, minimum 1 character  
- **userName**: Valid email format, will be used as login
- **departments**: At least one valid department ID selected

### Email Validation
- **Format check**: Standard email regex validation
- **Uniqueness**: No duplicate emails within the upload batch
- **Username requirement**: userName field must be valid email format

### Phone Number Validation
- **Format cleaning**: Remove spaces, dashes, parentheses
- **International support**: Accept various international formats
- **Optional field**: Valid if provided, ignored if empty

### Date Validation
- **Hire date format**: Must be YYYY-MM-DD if provided
- **Date parsing**: Attempt to parse various Excel date formats
- **Future date warning**: Alert for hire dates in the future

### Department Validation
- **Existence check**: Verify department IDs exist in customer's Planday portal
- **Access validation**: Ensure user has permission to assign to department

## Error Handling & Recovery

### Validation Error Categories
- **Missing required data**: Clear indication of which fields need values
- **Format errors**: Specific guidance on correct formats (email, phone, date)
- **Duplicate data**: Highlight duplicate emails within the batch
- **Reference errors**: Invalid department IDs or missing departments

### User-Friendly Error Messages
- **Specific guidance**: "Email format invalid - should be user@company.com"
- **Bulk fix suggestions**: "5 employees missing phone numbers - edit to continue"
- **Visual indicators**: Color-coded cells with tooltip error details
- **Progress feedback**: "23 of 25 employees valid - 2 issues remaining"

### Recovery Mechanisms
