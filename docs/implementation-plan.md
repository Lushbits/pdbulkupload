# Implementation Plan: Planday Bulk Employee Uploader

## Project Overview

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for building the Planday Bulk Employee Uploader - a client-side web application that enables Planday customers to bulk upload employees from Excel files with intelligent validation and atomic upload guarantees.

**Key Architecture Principles:**
- Zero server-side data storage (pure client-side application)
- All-or-nothing upload system with comprehensive pre-validation
- Direct Planday API integration from browser using OAuth2 refresh token flow
- Modern React + TypeScript + Vite stack

**Important API Insights:**
- Access tokens expire after 1 hour, refresh tokens don't expire
- All API calls require `X-ClientId` and `Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN` headers
- Employee creation uses specific field requirements and custom field handling
- Rate limiting and error handling follow documented patterns

- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds ✅
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v3.4.0 with custom design system ✅
- **State Management**: React hooks and context API ✅
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation ✅
- **File Processing**: SheetJS (xlsx) for Excel parsing ✅
- **HTTP Client**: Fetch API with custom wrapper for Planday API integration
- **Testing**: Jest + Playwright for comprehensive testing

### Planday API Integration Details
- **Base URL**: `https://openapi.planday.com/`
- **Authentication URL**: `https://id.planday.com/connect/token`
- **Required Headers**: `X-ClientId` and `Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN`
- **Token Expiration**: Access tokens expire after 1 hour, refresh tokens don't expire
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive handling of documented error codes (400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 429, 500)
- **Rate Limiting**: Exponential backoff for 429 errors
- **CORS**: Direct browser-to-Planday API calls with proper CORS handling

### Key Dependencies
```json
{
  "react": "^19.1.0", ✅
  "react-dom": "^19.1.0", ✅
  "react-router-dom": "^7.6.2", ✅
  "typescript": "~5.8.3", ✅
  "vite": "^6.3.5", ✅
  "tailwindcss": "^3.4.0", ✅
  "xlsx": "^0.18.5", ✅
  "jest": "^29.0.0",
  "@playwright/test": "^1.35.0"
}
```

### Security Considerations
- **Zero Data Storage**: All processing in browser memory only ✅
- **Token Security**: Refresh tokens stored in sessionStorage, cleared on refresh
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All communications encrypted
- **CORS Handling**: Direct browser-to-Planday API calls
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive client-side validation ✅
- **Error Handling**: No sensitive information in error messages

### Token Management Architecture
- **Session Storage**: Store refresh token in sessionStorage for persistence across page refreshes
- **Access Token Caching**: Cache access token in memory with expiration tracking
- **Proactive Refresh**: Refresh access token when 5 minutes from expiration
- **Upload Process Protection**: Check and refresh token before each batch upload
- **Graceful Degradation**: Clear error messaging if refresh fails during upload
- **Security Cleanup**: Clear all tokens on page close/refresh

**Token Refresh Flow:**
1. User provides refresh token once at start
2. System exchanges for access token and stores both securely
3. Before each API call, check if access token expires within 5 minutes
4. If expiring soon, automatically refresh using stored refresh token
5. Continue upload process seamlessly without user intervention
6. If refresh fails, show clear error and allow retry without re-entering token

### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading**: Code splitting for large components
- **Memoization**: React.memo and useMemo for expensive operations ✅
- **Chunked Processing**: Large files processed in chunks
- **Debounced Validation**: Real-time validation with debouncing
- **Optimized Builds**: Vite for fast development and production builds ✅

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
1. **API Rate Limiting**: Implement exponential backoff and batch processing for 429 errors
2. **Token Expiration**: Automatic refresh mechanism for 1-hour access token expiration
3. **Large File Performance**: Add file size limits and progress indicators
4. **Browser Memory Limits**: Implement chunked processing for large datasets
5. **Network Failures**: Comprehensive retry logic and error recovery
6. **CORS Issues**: Handle browser-to-Planday API calls with proper CORS configuration
7. **Scope Permission Errors**: Validate required scopes before upload operations

### User Experience Risks
1. **Complex Interface**: Intuitive design with clear guidance ✅
2. **Validation Confusion**: Real-time feedback and inline editing
3. **Upload Anxiety**: Clear progress tracking and atomic guarantees
4. **Authentication Confusion**: Clear guidance on refresh token requirements
5. **Error Message Clarity**: Translate Planday API errors into user-friendly messages

### Security Risks
1. **Token Exposure**: Memory-only storage with automatic clearing
2. **Data Leakage**: Zero server-side processing architecture ✅
3. **Network Security**: HTTPS enforcement and secure API calls
4. **Scope Overreach**: Only request necessary scopes for employee creation
5. **Token Refresh Security**: Secure handling of refresh token exchange
