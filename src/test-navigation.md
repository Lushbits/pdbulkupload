# Navigation Test Guide

## Testing the New Navigation Philosophy

### **Expected Behavior**

#### **Forward Navigation (→)**
1. **Column Mapping → ValidationCorrection**: Should ALWAYS show helpers
2. **Helpers Re-evaluation**: Even if previously completed, all helpers should be shown again
3. **Fresh Start**: Each forward journey should be independent

#### **Backward Navigation (←)**  
1. **ValidationCorrection → Column Mapping**: Should skip helpers and go directly
2. **State Reset**: Helper completion state should be cleared
3. **Clean Return**: Should be able to modify column mappings

### **Test Steps**

1. **Initial Forward Journey**
   - Go from Column Mapping to ValidationCorrection
   - Verify bulk corrections show (if any invalid names exist)
   - Complete bulk corrections
   - Verify date format modal shows (if ambiguous dates exist)
   - Complete date format selection
   - Reach individual data correction

2. **Back Navigation Test**
   - Click "Back" from individual data correction
   - Should go directly to Column Mapping (skip helpers)
   - Verify you're in Column Mapping step

3. **Re-Forward Navigation Test**  
   - Go forward from Column Mapping again
   - Should see bulk corrections AGAIN (even though previously completed)
   - Should see date format modal AGAIN (even though previously completed)
   - Should be able to modify previous decisions

### **Console Messages to Look For**

```
🔄 User navigating back to Column Mapping - resetting helper states
🔄 Resetting helper completion state for fresh forward navigation
🔍 Detecting error patterns for bulk correction - found X patterns
📋 Showing all detected patterns for user review
```

### **Key Validation Points**

✅ **Helpers always show when going forward**  
✅ **Back navigation skips helpers**  
✅ **Helper state resets properly**  
✅ **Can modify previous decisions**  
✅ **Component re-mounts with fresh state**
