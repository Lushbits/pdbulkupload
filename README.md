# Planday Bulk Employee Uploader

A secure, client-side web application for bulk uploading employees to Planday. Built with React, TypeScript, and privacy by design.

## 🎯 What It Does

Transform your employee onboarding process by uploading dozens or hundreds of employees to Planday in minutes instead of hours. This application provides:

- **Excel File Processing** - Upload employee data from Excel/CSV files
- **Smart Data Mapping** - Automatically maps columns to Planday fields with intelligent suggestions
- **Data Validation** - Comprehensive validation with error correction workflows
- **Duplicate Detection** - Identifies existing employees to prevent duplicates
- **Bulk Upload** - Efficiently uploads all employees with real-time progress tracking

## 🔒 Privacy & Security First

### **Local Processing - Your Data Stays With You**
- ✅ **Excel files processed entirely in your browser** - never uploaded to our servers
- ✅ **Only communicates with YOUR Planday portal** - no third-party data collection
- ✅ **No tracking, analytics, or cookies** - complete privacy by design
- ✅ **Open source code** - audit every line yourself

### **What Network Calls Are Made:**
1. **Planday API authentication** (to your portal only)
2. **Employee data upload** (directly to your Planday portal)
3. **Portal configuration retrieval** (departments, groups, field definitions)

### **What We DON'T Do:**
- ❌ Upload your Excel files anywhere
